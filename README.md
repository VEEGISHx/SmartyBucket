#####  Problem Statement

* Accurately keeping a list of household cooking expenditures to keep a household’s monthly spending within a certain budget limit can be a frustrating task and on top of that it can be difficult to decide which meals to prepare when on a limited budget.

* This can lead to families making poor healthy food choices. Organizing campaigns to teach people about budgeting and varying recipes can be expensive. ​

* To tackle these issues, we would like to propose a mobile solution that is free for all and can be widely distributed.​
​

#####  Aims & Objectives

​
* Allow users enter their monthly budget so as to keep track of their expenses. ​

* Allow users to use their phone cameras to scan their grocery list and extract every grocery item. ​

* Propose different recipes based on the groceries extracted from the list. ​

* Inform users about the total cost of each recipe proposed. ​

* Inform users about every item which is missing from their list in order to prepare a recipe. ​
